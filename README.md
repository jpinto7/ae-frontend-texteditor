# Simple text editor
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Initial setup
Run `npm install` in order to setup application

## Development server
Run `npm start` for a dev server.

## Notes
+ Text sample (`text.service.js`) is loaded to the editor
+ Context API is used
+ Color picker is now fully functional. I used the CompactPicker extracted from library react-color
+ When selecting a single word, an API call is made automatically to fetch synonyms of that word
